                <p class="description">Welcome to the future... of our past... </p>
                <p>When you don't know where to run, when you don't know where to hide, your best bet is to get in you car, insert your favorite cassette, and ride into the horizon with nothing but the music as your company. The neon lights will guide your way...</p>

                <p>A new city, a new beginning, and new enemies... You know they'll find you here, they are everywhere, but the show must go on. You know your hacking skills will get you to places, and they will be your undoing too. But this is the life you chose, and you must live with the consecuences.</p>

                <p>You knew you couldn't trust her. Something in your cybercortex didn't feel right every time she let you jack in to her vrv. But you did it anyway, and now you are here. Alone, bleeding like a chinese genopig about to be chopped. Nobody is going to hear you in in this dark alley, you are too weak and the bustling in the city is too loud. Steps, someone's approaching. Your alt-vision is some blurry red but it's her, you know it's her.</p>

                <p>You know this place. You've been here before. Good memories, bad food. "You alright?" she says. "The bullet got to your stomach, good luck it's one of those swapable ST-200 models". She opens a bottle of Kirin. "Here. Don't worry you won't leak inside, I did the swapping myself".</p>
                    <center><img src="/home/rodrigo/Gitproject/git_test/Outrun_webpage/Pictures/synth-retrowave-synthwave-fon-new-retro-wave-sintveiv-ret-22.jpg" height=500px width=700px alt="Black silouette of a woman against a colorfull background"></center>
                <p>As she walks away to the bar you check for your spare gun behind the desk. It's still there. You point it at her as she turns your way. "Why". A question without an answer. Your Alt-Vision starts to fall apart into a thousand lines of ascending micro code. You try to pull the trigger but it's alredy late, you neuronection has been disconnected. All is black now, empty, and yet... you can feel her by your side.</p>
                    <center><img src="/home/rodrigo/Gitproject/git_test/Outrun_webpage/Pictures/40203.jpg" height=500px width=700px alt="Lines of code"></center>
                <p>"You shouldn't have messed with the Kuroda Corporation". It's only a whisper, yet her voice rattles and echoes like a million voices inside you. "They wanted you and the core-matrix you stole. And I intend to provide". Now you start seeing it. Faintly at first, just a small green dot in the distance, growing bigger and brighter each second. The code stars to become clearer each time, and you can clearly see what it is. She must have implanted it during your jack-in sessions without you noticing it. How naive were you. You have no right to call yourself a Cybercortex hacker after this. You lost. The Corps win this time. The last time</p>

                <p>"Good boy. You are my ticket out. Have a nice trip kiddo."</p>
